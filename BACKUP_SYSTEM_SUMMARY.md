- Audit logging of all operations

## Integration Points

### Navigation Menu
- Added backup menu item to existing admin sidebar
- Seamless integration with current UI theme
- Proper role-based access control

### Page Routing
- Added 'backup_admin' to admin pages array in index.php
- Follows existing routing patterns
- Maintains security checks

### Database Connection
- Uses existing database configuration
- Compatible with current PDO setup
- No changes to existing database structure

## Usage

### Web Interface
1. Login as admin (role_id = 1)
2. Navigate to "จัดการ Backup" in the admin menu
3. Use buttons to create backups, manage files, or restore data

### Command Line
```bash
# Create database backup
php backup/auto_backup.php database

# Create files backup
php backup/auto_backup.php files

# Create full backup
php backup/auto_backup.php full

# Run cleanup
php backup/cleanup.php

# Dry run cleanup (preview)
php backup/cleanup.php --dry-run
```

### Cron Job Setup
```bash
# Daily database backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/backup/auto_backup.php database

# Weekly full backup on Sunday at 1 AM
0 1 * * 0 /usr/bin/php /path/to/backup/auto_backup.php full

# Daily cleanup at 3 AM
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/backup/cleanup.php
```

## Configuration

### Main Settings (backup_config.php)
- `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`: Number of days to keep backups (default: 7)
- `BACKUP_DIR`: Directory for storing backup files
- `EXCLUDE_DIRS`: Directories to exclude from file backups
- `EXCLUDE_FILES`: File patterns to exclude from backups

### Database Settings
- Uses existing database configuration from main project
- No additional database setup required

## Testing Results

### Syntax Validation
- All PHP files pass syntax checks
- No conflicts with existing code
- Proper error handling implemented

### Functionality Tests
- Configuration system works correctly
- Class loading and instantiation successful
- Directory permissions properly set
- Security controls functioning

### Integration Tests
- Admin menu integration working
- Page routing functioning correctly
- Authentication system integrated
- No impact on existing functionality

## Maintenance

### Log Files
- `backup/backup.log` - Main system log
- Automatic log rotation at 10MB
- Detailed operation tracking

### Monitoring
- System status dashboard in admin interface
- Disk space monitoring
- Backup count tracking
- Error detection and reporting

### Updates
- System designed for easy maintenance
- Modular architecture allows component updates
- Configuration-based customization

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Admin-only access enforced
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based permission checks

### File Protection
- Backup directory protected from web access
- .htaccess rules for additional security
